# Data-Preprocessing-Analysis-for-the-Used-Car-Market
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive data preprocessing analysis to understand and explore the behavior of the used car market. This preparatory analysis is crucial for conducting an effective Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and gaining valuable insights that can be used to make informed decisions.

Steps Taken:

Initial Data Loading:

The initial data, containing information about used cars, was loaded into a DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.
Data Cleaning:

A thorough data cleaning process was carried out to address missing values, duplicates, and potential errors in key variables.
Statistical Analysis:

Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to understand the distribution and key characteristics of relevant variables such as year, price, tax, fuel efficiency, and engine size.
Feature Scaling:

Feature scaling was applied to numeric variables using techniques such as MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler to standardize and normalize the data, respectively.
Feature Selection:

Feature selection was conducted using methods like SelectKBest to identify the most relevant variables in relation to the price of used cars.
Train-Test Data Split:

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to facilitate the evaluation of future models.
Export of Preprocessed Data:

The preprocessed and selected data were exported to separate CSV files, such as "clean_price_train.csv" and "clean_price_test.csv."
